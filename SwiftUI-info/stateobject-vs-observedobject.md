## Difference Between `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` in SwiftUI

Both `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` are property wrappers in SwiftUI that establish a connection between the user interface and data models. This ensures the UI updates when the data changes. However, they serve different contexts and have distinct lifecycles.

### 1. Ownership and Lifecycle

- **@StateObject**
  - Indicates the view **owns** the object.
  - The object is created **once** for the lifecycle of the view.
  - It **won't** be deallocated or reinitialized while the view is in memory.
  - Ideal for objects created and managed by the current view.

- **@ObservedObject**
  - Indicates the view only **observes** the object but doesn't own it.
  - The object's lifecycle is managed **outside** the view.
  - It may be deallocated if there's no other strong reference and the parent view is recreated.
  - Use for objects that are created outside and passed into the view.

### 2. Initialization

- **@StateObject**
  - Ensures single initialization during the view's lifecycle.
  - Safe to initialize directly in the view declaration.

- **@ObservedObject**
  - Doesn't guarantee single initialization.
  - Not safe to initialize directly in the view declaration as they could be reinitialized.

### 3. Use Cases

- **@StateObject**
  - Objects created and owned by the view.
  - Objects that stay alive for the entire lifecycle of the view.

- **@ObservedObject**
  - Objects created elsewhere and passed to the view.
  - Objects with a lifecycle independent of the view.

### Conclusion

If a view creates an observed object, use `@StateObject`. If the object is created outside the view and passed in, use `@ObservedObject`. The right choice ensures correct behavior and lifecycle management in SwiftUI views and models.
